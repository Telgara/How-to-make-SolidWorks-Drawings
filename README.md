# INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this instruction is to introduce the basic concepts of creating SolidWorks drawings. SolidWorks has all the needed features for creating a professional drawing, and for transforming your concepts into reality.
# Getting started
This instruction will:
* Introduce the main concepts of SolidWorks Drawings
* Explain how to create a drawing and choose a custom sheet size
* Demonstrate the single design component from different views
* Add dimensions to the scheme  

Prerequisites:
* Make sure you have [SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/support/community-download#no-back) installed with the drawing creation ability (мersion 2021 or higher is required)
* Have an understanding of using and creating SolidWorks part file
* You can use this practice [example](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s6IYy6kvwLmyibqGsZ2YoUXnnX7jKRGC?usp=sharing) of a part file which is used in this tutorial.

Terminology:
* Drawing document/sheet - document with annotated drawing on object;
* Dimensions - linear or angular measurement of particular item;
* Drawing views: standart orientations, section, projected, detailed, etc - views of representing the object from different views/angles;
* Section view - divided on the sections object is demonstrated in details;
* Broken-out view - demonstration of object with cutted away part;
* Crop view - view of object focused on particular region.

# Instructions step-by-step
**Step 1. Getting started**    
Launch SolidWorks and create or select a part file you intend to make a drawing of.

</p>  

**Step 2. Creating the drawing file**   
After you have opened your part file, navigate to the “File” toolbar and select the “Make Drawing from Part” option.

</p>  

**Step 3. Custom your sheet size**  
Choose the desired sheet size and orientation. If the desired sheet size is not available, you can select the “Custom Sheet Size” option to create your own sheet with personalized parameters.

</p>  

**Step 4. Adding views**  
Use the "View palette" tool on the right-hand side of the screen to add the desired part views. Many distinct view types are available, including _front_, _back_, _top_ and _isometric_ views.

</p>  

>If you want to show your part file from other views, you can use _section_, _broken-out_ and _crop_ views. The instruction for such view types is provided below.  

a) Section View
Select a “Section View” function in the “Drawing” tool to make a half section view of the part. Drag the section view to the needed location.

</p>  

b) Broken-out view
Select the “Broken-out Section” option in the “Drawing” tool. Circle the required area of the view by putting dots on the drawing sheet and joining them as shown below. Specify the depth of the cut and click OK.

</p>  

c) Crop view  
Choose the area of the part that you want to preserve, the rest will be cut out. Then, select the “Crop View” option within the “Drawing” tool.

</p>  

**Step 5. Adding Dimensions and Annotations to the Drawing**  
To add all the dimensions of the drawing, select the “Model Items” option within the “Annotations” tool. Then, choose the items, which you want to show dimension to, and click OK. Solidworks will assign dimensions automatically.

</p>  

In order to add specific dimensions manually, click on the “Smart Dimensions” tool. You can select the type of dimension you want to add, such as _linear_ or _angular_, and then click on the points you want to measure. For example, displaying the _radius_ of the selected part.

</p>  

**Step 6. Editing sheet format**    
Use the "Edit Sheet Format" tool to add notes and labels to the drawing.

</p>  

After properly positioning the view and arranging dimensions, your drawing is ready.

**Step 7. Save file**     
Once the technical drawing is finished, save the file and export it in the specified file format, such as a **PDF** or **DXF** file.

# Troubleshooting tips  
* **Verify the drawing sheet's settings:** Verify that the drawing sheet size is suitable for the drawing you are producing. In the Sheet Format tab in the File menu, you can modify the sheet size.
* **Make sure the part or assembly is completely defined:** Verify that all parts and assemblies are fully defined. The drawing might not show the right information if a part or assembly is underdefined.
* **Verify that your software is up to date:** Update your SolidWorks program to the most recent version. To accomplish this, choose "Help" > "Check for Updates" from the SolidWorks menu.
