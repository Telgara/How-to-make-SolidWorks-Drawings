# INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this instruction manual is to introduce the basic concepts of creating SolidWorks drawings. With a user-friendly interface, cutting-edge features, and seamless integration with other tools and applications, SolidWorks enables designers and engineers to bring their ideas to life with unparalleled accuracy and efficiency. Whether you're a seasoned professional or a student learning the ropes of CAD design, SolidWorks is an ideal choice for transforming your concepts into reality.
# Getting started
This instruction will:
* Introduce main concepts of SolidWorks Drawings
* Explain how to create Drawing part, choose custom sheet size
* Demonstrate the single design component from different views (front, bottom, right, left, section and other views)
* Add dimensions on the scheme  

Prerequisites:
* Make sure you have [SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/support/community-download#no-back) installed with drawings creation ability. Version 2021 or higher is required
* Have an understanding of using and creating SolidWorks part file
* You can use the [example](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s6IYy6kvwLmyibqGsZ2YoUXnnX7jKRGC?usp=sharing) of the part file used in this tutorial for the practice.

Definitions/Terms used:
* Drawing document/sheet
* Dimensions
* Drawing views: standart orientations, section, projected, detailed, etc

# Instructions step-by-step
**Step 1.** Launch SolidWorks on your computer and create or select a part file you intend to make a drawing of.

</p>  

**Step 2. Creating drawing file**   
After you have opened your part file, navigate to the “File” toolbar and select the “Make Drawing from Part” option.

</p>  

**Step 3. Custom sheet size**  
Choose the desired sheet size and orientation. In case the desired sheet size is not available, you can select the “Custom sheet size” option to create your own sheet with personalized parameters.

</p>  

**Step 4. Adding views**  
Use the "View palette" tool on the right-hand of the screen to add the desired part views. There are many distinct view types available, including _front_, _back_, _top_ and _isometric_ views.

</p>  

>In case you want to show your part file from other views, you can use _section_, _broken-out_ and _crop_ views. The instruction for such view types is provided below.  

a) Select a “Section View” function in the “Drawing” tool to make a half section view of the part. Drag the section view to its place.

</p>  

b) Broken-out  
Select a “Broken-out Section” option in the “Drawing” tool. Circle the required area of the view by putting dots on the drawing sheet and joining them as shown below. Specify the depth of the cut and click OK.

</p>  

c) Crop view  
Sketch the area of the part that you want to preserve, the rest will be cut out. Then select a “Crop view” option in “Drawing” tool.

</p>  

**Step 5. Adding Dimensions and Annotations to the Drawing**  
To add all the dimensions of the drawing, select the “Model Items” option in the “Annotations” tool. Then, choose the parts and click OK. Program will assign dimensions automatically.

</p>  

In order to add specific dimensions manually, click on the “Smart Dimensions” tool. You can select the type of dimension you want to add, such as _linear_ or _angular_, and then click on the points you want to measure. For example, displaying the _radius_ of the selected part.

</p>  

**Step 6. Edit sheet format**
Use the "Edit sheet format" tool to add notes and labels to the drawing.

</p>  

After properly positioning the view and arranging dimensions, your drawing is ready.

**Step 7.** Once the technical drawing is finished, save the file and export it in the specified file format, such as a **PDF** or **DXF** file.

# Troubleshooting tips  
* **Verify the drawing sheet's settings:** Verify that the drawing sheet size is suitable for the drawing you are producing. In the Sheet Format tab in the File menu, you can modify the sheet size.
* **Make sure the part or assembly is completely defined:** Verify that all parts and assemblies are fully defined. The drawing might not show the right information if a part or assembly is underdefined.
* **Verify that your software is up to date:** Update your SolidWorks program to the most recent version. To accomplish this, choose "Help" > "Check for Updates" from the SolidWorks menu.
